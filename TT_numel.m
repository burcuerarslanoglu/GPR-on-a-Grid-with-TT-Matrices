    %TT_numel(tt_1,tt_2,tt_sum) 
    %  computes numbrt of elements of TT-decomposition
    %      
    %INPUT:
    %   tt (cell array with N+1 cells): tensor train (tt) decomposition of a 
    %                                   N-th order tensor, which has been
    %                                   computed with hidden_TT_SVD right
    %                                   before. Here, the tt-cores 
    %                                   are stored in the first N cells and the 
    %                                   location of the norm-core is stored in the 
    %                                   N+1 cell. If the tt is not in site_n
    %                                   mixed canonical form, the N+1 cell
    %                                   contains a 0.
    % %OUTPUT:
    %   noe (double):                   number of elements of TT-decompositions, 
    %                                   which are stored in first N cores. 
    %                                   The element stored in the N+1th core
    %                                   does NOT(!) count towards the number of
    %                                   elements of TT-decomposition.
